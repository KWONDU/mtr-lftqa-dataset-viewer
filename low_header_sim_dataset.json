        "question": "What does the document containing the local_govt_mdm table, specifically the cmi_cross_references and council_tax sections, reveal about the mapping of services to their corresponding CMI cross-reference IDs, particularly in relation to the source system codes for \"Rent\" and \"Benefits\"?",
        "answer": "The table set document reveals a comprehensive mapping of various services and their corresponding CMI cross-reference IDs, particularly highlighting the relationships between master customer IDs and source system codes. For instance, the source system code \"Rent\" is associated with multiple CMI cross-reference IDs, including 2, 8, 59, and 100, indicating a significant focus on rental services within the local government framework. Additionally, the \"Benefits\" source system code appears frequently, with IDs such as 41, 48, 49, 75, and 83, suggesting that benefits-related services are also a major component of the local government's offerings.",

        "question": "How does the local government categorize services using CMI cross-reference IDs in the local_govt_mdm table, and what implications do these IDs have for council tax as indicated in the council_tax table, particularly in relation to the overlap of services such as the Rent service linked to CMI cross-reference ID 101?",
        "answer": "Analyzing the data, it becomes evident that the local government utilizes a systematic approach to categorize services through the CMI cross-reference IDs, which serve as a bridge between different service types and their respective council tax implications. The overlap of CMI cross-reference IDs between the local_govt_mdm and council_tax tables indicates that certain services, particularly those related to taxation, are critical in the administration of local government functions. For example, the CMI cross-reference ID 101 is linked to both the Rent service and council tax, highlighting the interconnectedness of these services in the local governance structure.",
