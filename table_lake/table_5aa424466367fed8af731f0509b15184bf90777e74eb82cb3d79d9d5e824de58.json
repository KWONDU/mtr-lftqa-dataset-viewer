    "metadata": "Sotho verbs | Verbal derivatives | Verb derivations using the root \n  \n -qet- The traditional verb root used to demonstrate these derivations (and form their traditional names; by using the class 5 noun prefix \n le- \n and changing the final vowel to \n -i \n ) is \n -ets- \n (do, act, make). The problem with this root is that the \n ts \n consonant tends to greatly complicate the forms of the derivatives (due to \n alveolarization \n ), and it has been felt wise in this table to use a verb root with more neutral sounds. Note that the \n e \n in \n  \n -qet- regularly undergoes \n vowel raising \n when followed by certain vowels and consonants, but this is a simpler and more predictable phenomenon than the various complications brought on by the \n ts \n consonant. Compare this with the situation in \n Arabic \n where the verb \u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e (Fa\u02bfala \"he did\") traditionally used to indicated the various verb forms often confuses non-native learners due to the \n \u02bfAin \n \u0639 sound being confused with that of the \n Hamza \n \u0621 that appears in some forms (such as the causative stem IV \u0623\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064e 'Af\u02bfala).",
